The pumped-storage power plant 
will operate by using two reservoirs 
to generate power, an upper and a lower. 
During periods of high energy demand, 
water is released from the upper reservoir 
and sent to the power station to generate 
electricity. After power generation, 
the water is discharged into the lower reservoir. 
When energy demand is low, such as at night, 
water is pumped back up to the upper reservoir 
as stored energy. The process repeats as needed 
and the pump-generators serve the dual-role of 
both pumping and generating electricity.
