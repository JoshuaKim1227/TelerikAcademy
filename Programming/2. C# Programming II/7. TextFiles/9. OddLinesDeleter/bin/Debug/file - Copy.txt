Strings are collections of characters.
The C# language introduces the string type.
This type allows us to manipulate character
data through methods and properties.
It provides methods to concatenate, append,
replace, search and split.
Consider a string of characters.
A string is a class that holds characters
and provides operations such as subscripting,
concatenation, and comparison that we usually
associated with the notion of a "string."
