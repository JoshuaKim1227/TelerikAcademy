        // It provides methods to concatenate, append, replace, search and split.

        // Methods:
        // IndexOf - This method finds the first index of the char argument. It returns -1 if the char was not found
        // Join - Combines many strings into one
        // Replace - It changes all occurrences of one substring into another substring
        // Length - It returns how many characters are in the string
        // Substring - It acquires a substring of any string
    }
